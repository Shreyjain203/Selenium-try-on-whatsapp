# Whatsapp-Automation-Using-Selenium

The code within this repository is tailored for sending messages to multiple contacts in a repetitive manner, utilizing Selenium and the Chrome WebDriver. There are just two constraints to consider:
1. Upon the initial run, you'll be required to scan the WhatsApp Web QR code.
2. The contact names must precisely match the saved names on your phone, including letter case sensitivity.
